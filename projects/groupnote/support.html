          This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the

        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and
          use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal
          Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the

        <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
        <p>
          For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to
          provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including
          but not limited to an email address. The information that I request
          will be stored in the cloud on Google's Firestore database. This

        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>
          I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we
          are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
          But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
          method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
          guarantee its absolute security. For this reason, I strongly urge
          users not to save sensitive information using this application.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
        <p>
          This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
          third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
          external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise
          you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control
          over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies,
          or practices of any third-party sites or services.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p>
        <p>
          These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not
          knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
          under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me
          with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers.
          If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has
          provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I
          will be able to do necessary actions.
        </p>

          I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are
          advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will
          notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
          page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on
          this page.
